    question: 'How are tarantulas shipped?',
    answer: 'We ship tarantulas in secure containers with proper ventilation and moisture. They\'re packaged in insulated boxes with heat packs during colder months to maintain appropriate temperatures. We only ship via couriers that can guarantee delivery within 1-2 days within South Africa.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What species are available?',
    answer: 'We regularly stock a variety of species ranging from beginner-friendly (like Brachypelma hamorii and Tliltocatl albopilosum) to more advanced species (like Poecilotheria metallica). Our inventory changes frequently, so check our Shop page for current availability or contact us for specific inquiries.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I set up a proper enclosure?',
    answer: 'Proper enclosures vary by species. Terrestrial species need more floor space with 3-4 inches of substrate, while arboreal species need taller enclosures with climbing opportunities. All enclosures should have proper ventilation, a water dish, and appropriate hiding spots. See our Care Guide for detailed species-specific information.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What do tarantulas eat?',
    answer: 'Tarantulas primarily eat insects such as crickets, roaches, and mealworms. The size and frequency of feeding depend on the tarantula\'s size and age. Spiderlings eat more frequently (2-3 times per week) while adult tarantulas may only need to feed once every 1-2 weeks.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Are tarantulas dangerous?',
    answer: 'While all tarantulas possess venom, most species kept as pets have venom that\'s not medically significant to humansâ€”comparable to a bee sting. However, some species (particularly Old World species from Africa and Asia) have more potent venom and defensive temperaments. All tarantulas should be handled with care and respect, and handling should be minimized or avoided entirely.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long do tarantulas live?',
    answer: 'Lifespan varies significantly by species and gender. Male tarantulas typically live 3-7 years after reaching maturity, while females of many species can live 15-30+ years with proper care. Species like Brachypelma and Grammostola are known for their exceptional longevity.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you accept returns?',
    answer: 'Due to the nature of live animals, we cannot accept returns of tarantulas unless they arrive dead or severely injured, in which case we require photographic evidence within 24 hours of delivery. Accessories and supplies can be returned within 14 days if unused and in original packaging.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you ship internationally?',
    answer: 'No, we currently only ship within South Africa due to regulations regarding the transport of exotic animals across international borders and to ensure the welfare of our tarantulas during transit.'
